# Hi, I’m Cassandra Suzanne :>

### Aspiring Full-Stack Developer • Game Dev • Data-Driven Scientist

I’m a third-year **BSc student majoring in Astrophysics & Biochemistry**, based in Australia, with a strong interest in building **apps, games, and data-driven systems**.

My background in science taught me how to:
- think analytically
- extract & interpret data
- write clear reports for teams
- and learn complex systems quickly  

I now apply those skills to **software development**, with a long-term goal of working as a **Full-Stack Developer** while continuing toward a future **PhD in Astrophysics**.

---

## 🌌 What I’m Working Toward

- **Aspiring Full-Stack Developer** (Web + Mobile)
- **Game Developer** (2D now, 3D next)
- **Data Analyst** (currently working toward the *Microsoft Data Analyst Certification*)
- Contributor to open-source & collaborative projects
- Long-term: research-focused career in astrophysics

---

## 🧠 Academic Background (Why It Matters)

**BSc – Astrophysics & Biochemistry (3rd year)**  
Key skills gained through science & research:
- Python-based data analysis
- Unix environments (bash / PowerShell / command line)
- Scientific programming (Fortran, C)
- Data extraction, cleaning, and visualization
- Writing concise technical reports for teams

This background strongly influences how I approach software:
**clean logic, reproducible results, and clear communication.**
